<p>Cannabis users always want finely ground buds as it results in a different high therefore, they want the same option when it comes to vaping. The best temperature to vape at depends on what you want out of your high. State level legalization in the U.S has made vaping a convenient and discrete norm. High tech Gadgets allow users to curate their experience by having the high according to their expectations.</p>
<h2><strong>Vaping oil is the new standard</strong></h2>
<p><span>In the past few years, tremendous use of vaping cannabis oil has introduced many people to this legal pot. Vaping oils are less smelly, produce no smoke and give mellow and manageable experience to users.   </span></p>
<p><span>In an interview, JJ O'Brien, VP of Strategy at Pax Labs said, n “You have all of this plant but a lot of its parts don’t impact your high whatsoever.  In its non-flower form, extract of the plant provides the active compound to the user.” </span></p>
<p><span>Vape oil is available at legal stores and users can also buy cheap, reusable and rechargeable batteries that allow a few temperature settings.  </span></p>
<p><span>The response of the company to its oil boom is at $29.99 the Pax Era. Users can’t buy any oil as company’s Era uses specific cannabis pods. This limits the variety of oils that users can buy but it gives a little bit more of a high-end experience. </span></p>
<p><span>The Era is app-connected and allows the users to unlock a number of features and temperature control from a smartphone. The vape can be set between 430<sup>0</sup>F to 790<sup>0</sup>F. </span></p>

<h2><strong>No temperature is the right temperature</strong></h2>
<p><span>O’Brien said, "In cannabis consumption, every single active compound like cannabinoids or terpenes add a lot to consumer’s holistic high and they all have different boiling points. Temperature is crucial in cannabis experience to consume all active compounds at the right heat.”</span></p>
<p><span>Some cannabinoids can withstand a higher temperature to have a variety of effects on users but terpenes, the essential oils of the plant, cannot. Vaping at a lower temperature has perfume-like flavor, while a higher temperature it produces vapors and gives intense high. </span></p>
<p><span>O'Brien admitted that "The joint is the best vaporizer. It is burning on one end when you're pulling hot air through a controlled environment because you've wrapped the paper. You're actually hitting that flower with different heats as the combustion cools coming into your mouth."</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to find your best temperature? </strong></h2>
<p><span>Start vaping at low temperature as waiting a decent amount of time between hits will allow you to take in how your body and mind are altered.</span></p>
<p><span>For the excellent results on the Era, select a dosage on the session control section of the app and slowly increase the temperature each time you vape. Cannabis effects are cumulative, so this may take days or even weeks to find the perfect temperature for each situation. </span></p>
<p><span>Beware of how hard and how long you are pulling if you don't have an Era and can't control the dose of your session. Charge your battery often to experience excellent results. </span></p>

<p><strong>What can fine-tuning provide in the future?</strong></p>
<p>The acceptance of cannabis is attributed to its ability to provide an essentially same high over and over again, which other strains like vape temperature can provide once but not repeatedly. What is the intensity and duration of the inhalation? What is THC and CBD for it? Fine tuning is important as it helps quantify temperature and dosage of cannabis according to personal preference. Canada is looking for the characteristics of the activating agents in it, in order to improve quantity and high. But till then cannabis consumers are on their own trial and hit method.</p>

<p>Mac Miller is known for his peculiar charming personality, artistry and going by various handles like Larry Fisherman, Delusional Thomas, and Easy Mac. Mac used to embrace his different public images even the Twitter account parody that used his likeness. Recently savvy fans have found out that in reality, Pittsburgh rappers use another moniker that was used exclusively on his secret Instagram account. Mac assumed the role of Lars under the name <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cloudywithachanceofawesome69/">@cloudywithachanceofawesome69</a></strong>. Lars was a vape-loving dude with a goal to inspire the world with one vape trick at a time. He personified the charismatic personality of Miller because the account was to be viewed as a manual on how to "maximize the level of fitness."  Vape –filled antics, posted on the page included blowing tomatoes and smoke out of his nostrils.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>According to All-Party Parliamentary Group for Vaping (APPGV), employers should be provided indoor and outside vaping areas. PMs don’t have any obvious vaping area and they want to be allowed to vape in parliament unless there are legitimate safety and professional concerns to stop it. They want to vape to be more acceptable around the workplace with guidelines for "reasonable vaping etiquette."</p>
<p>According to APPGV chairman, Mark Pawsey, “Current anti-vaping culture of Britain has given a "false" impression to the public that passive vaping is harmful like passive smoking. There are two designated vaping locations and despite being a member for eight years I don’t know their location.”</p>

<p>Vaping is 95% less harmful than regular cigarettes as they don’t create harmful and toxic tobacco smoke but British Heart Foundation doesn't allow non-smokers to use e-cigarettes.</p>
<p>Hazel Cheeseman, Director of Policy for Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said, ”Since long, Public health organizations like ASH and PHE are asking for clear policies to distinguish vaping and smoking. Employers of organizations must be educated that vaping is less harmful and its use in the workplace depends on individual circumstances. Vaping has no risks linked to health and courtesy in the working environment. ”</p>
<p>In prisons where up to 80% of people smoke are now buying vaping products than tobacco. A report by PHE published in 2015 states that e-cigarettes are "game changer" in regards to helping prisons go smoke-free. Prior to the start of the project 50,000 prisoners were buying tobacco but today, prison canteens sell over 65,000 vaping protects to 33,000 prisoners.  </p>

<p>According to Public Health Matters, 80% prisoners and 14.9% of adults in England smoke tobacco. Being safer than tobacco vaping can reduce the massive reduction in 78,000 smoke-related deaths every year England.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Sun, Daniel Pryor, Head of Programmes at the Adam Smith Institute said, "Britain’s businesses should make it as easy as possible for smokers to switch to e-cigs, which are at least 95 percent safer than cigarettes. Scientific evidence has shown no risks of passive vaping so vaping can be done indoor with no barriers to health concerns and personal freedom. ”</p>
<p>The New Nicotine Alliance (NNA) has welcomed the Parliamentary report saying: "The Parliamentary estate has become vape-friendly and sends a strong message to other employers and venue owners that vaping is healthy.”</p>
<p>Out of 3.2 million vapers in the UK, 1.7 million have switched to e-cigarettes by quitting smoking. Most smokers still hesitate due to a misconception about vaping. Many liberal workplace policies can fix this misconception and encourage smokers to choose to vape.”</p>
<p>In August, MPs called NHS free e-cigs as “key weapon” in health services to stop smoking arsenal. </p>

    <title>Reality check: Study says the more young people vape, the less they smoke</title>

<div class="story-txt" style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">A new research has shown that vaping or use of e-cigarettes has reduces the number of traditional smokers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This study was done by Georgetown University Medical Center and was published in the Tobacco Control journal. In the years between 2013 to 2017 they took data from children of grade 10 and 12 and found that with the increased popularity of vaping in 2014, the number of young smokers was decreased twice as much as previous years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The study author David Levy said.  “This finding is important because it indicates the [U.S.] experienced a major reduction in youth and young adult cigarette smoking when vaping became more popular.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He also said, “Vaping has had a positive effect on reducing cigarette smoking. On a population level, any effect that vaping may have had act as a gateway to cigarette smoking during the time frame examined appears to be small relative to the effects of vaping leading to less smoking.”</p>
<p><strong>WATCH: Study says e-cigarettes lead many teens to tobacco</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">But Levy explained to Global News that it’s hard to know whether or not a high schooler who smokes did so because they tried vaping first.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“If they would have smoked anyway, we shouldn’t be as alarmed about vaping, but unfortunately that kind of thing is hard to tease out,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“So what we’re doing is looking at what’s been happening overall with smoking and vaping.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Any effect that vaping may have had act as a gateway to cigarette smoking during the time frame examined appears to be small relative to the effects of vaping leading to less smoking,” he explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Levy also explained that “the trends indicate, at worst, that vaping didn’t increase smoking, and at best, they might have drastically reduced smoking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He also said more data would be needed on other outside effects — such as government policies or anti-smoking campaigns — so he would like to look over more years before drawing firm conclusions.</p>

<p><strong>Is Vaping better than smoking?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robert Schwartz, University of Toronto professor and executive director of the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit said that there may be an association but there isn’t strong evidence that smoking was decreased due to increased vaping.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span>His words were, “They’ve found an association; as vaping has gone up smoking has gone down. That doesn’t mean that vaping has caused a decrease in smoking. Does it mean that people who vape are not picking up smoking? I don’t know if we can actually tell that from this study?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A 2017 study on 44,000 high school students in Ontario and Alberta showed a strong and robust link between vaping and resulted in tobacco use.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Levy explained to Global News that, “If the students had smoked anyway we shouldn’t be too much alarmed about vaping. We are just looking at what’s overall happening with smoking and vaping. Any effect that vaping may have had is small relative to the effects of vaping causing decreased smoking. Vaping has drastically decreased smoking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He also said that before drawing any final conclusion more data through government policies or anti-smoking campaigns on outside effects is needed.</p>

    <title>Is vaping a healthier alternative to cigarettes?</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>CLEVELAND - E-companies have to follow the new guideline of Food and Drug Administration to stop young generation from adopting this habit and keeping them out of their hands.</p>
<p>News 5 asked the question in the middle of crackdown:  Is vaping a healthier substitute for traditional cigarettes?</p>
<p>Briefly, its still up in air.                                                                                  </p>
<p>In Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Humberto Choi is the head of pulmonary medicine department. He said that vaping is fairly a new trend but it has been long that no research is done on it.</p>
<p>In any way, vaping is a healthier substitute for smokers but it's not a healthy habit for the .non-smokers to adopt.</p>
<p>Dr.Humberto Choi said five to ten puffs of vaping are equivalent to one cigarette.</p>
<p>According to Dr.Humberto Choi, "It depends on how deep someone inhales the puff. In past, electronic cigarettes had much lower levels than the higher levels of nicotine in cigarettes available in the market nowadays."</p>
<p>Dr.Humberto Choi also said that it is hard to claim that vaping is less dangerous because this hobby comes with few health risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dr.Humberto Choi said “Formaldehyde is associated with cancer and it can be found in electronic cigarettes. Several chemicals are not exactly regulated in the liquids and it’s the major problem."<img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/7014/4344/files/smoking_vs_vaping_2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1543898825" style="float: none; margin: 20px 10px 20px 10px;"></p>
<p>Various ingredients like propylene glycol are regulated in vape juice. It may sound unfamiliar but a variety of snack foods, salad dressings, and iced coffees contain this ingredient.</p>
<p>Because of all this Matthew Davis has made the switch.</p>
<p>According to Davis, “There’s so many unknown variables and unknown different chemicals in the cigarette."</p>
<p>He started smoking at the age of 18 years but could not stand it because his health started suffering a lot. He felt breathless while going up on stairs.</p>
<img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/7014/4344/files/Ambience_life_large.jpg?v=1543898732" style="float: right; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><br>
<p>He said. “I’m able to run upstairs. I’m able to be more active, instead of being that slump all of the time."</p>
<p>Davis is the customer of Groov-E-Juice, a shop that makes Vape juices with a variety of nicotine free choices, in Kent.</p>
<p>Jason Noble, a shop owner at the top of Water Street Tavern, “Once they put the cigarettes down, they say it all the time. The steps are no problem."</p>
<p>FDA interdicts the shop owners from promoting vaping as a healthy substitute, but it also states that people who have switched from traditional cigarettes to vaping feel better.</p>
<p>Dr. Choi said only time will tell whether vaping is a healthy substitute for traditional cigarettes or not.</p>]]>

    <title>These new vape companies want you to inhale ... vitamins</title>
    <author>

      <![CDATA[<figure class="e-image e-image--hero" style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/7014/4344/products/Quattro_large.jpg?v=1539152263" alt=""><br>

<div class="c-entry-content">
<p id="aGDU7R">I sit in my living room, contemplating the slim, smooth aquamarine tube. Its color is a few shades removed from Tiffany blue, and it’s an inch or so longer than a cigarette. I do not smoke anything ever, but in order to psyche myself up for the full experience of the thing, I try to channel that famous picture of Audrey Hepburn on the<span> </span><em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em>movie poster, a long, slim cigarette holder hanging out of her mouth.</p>
<p id="p8UsSo">This isn’t a cigarette, though. It’s a Breathe “citrus flavored vitamin B12 mist” — a.k.a. a vitamin vape. It costs $45 for three pens. And disposable vaporizer pens like this one, containing substances like vitamins and essential oils instead of nicotine “e-juice,” are increasingly being marketed to wellness-minded consumers.</p>
<p id="KCo2BB">After one drag on the vaguely sweet-tasting vape, I promptly start coughing, spewing out a fruity puff of vapor. It doesn’t really feel like wellness. It feels like a violation of my alveoli.</p>
<p id="Sj0Szq">Vapes, or e-cigarettes, are all over the news right now, especially<span> </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/5/1/17286638/juul-vaping-e-cigarette">Juul</a>, the brand that’s trendy among teens because of its sleek profile and fruity flavors. They’re so popular and so controversial that the<span> </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/9/12/17850598/fda-juul-vaping">Food and Drug Administration</a><span> </span>is now actively targeting manufacturers that push nicotine vapes; it may even move to ban some. There is growing concern in the medical and public health communities about the immediate harmful effects on young people’s developing brains and bodies and the unknown longer-term effects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/7014/4344/files/Happy-News01_large.jpg?v=1540486786" alt=""></p>

<div></div>
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/172968584/vox/vox.com/the-goods_3__container__">But there is another market popping up whose purveyors suggest vaping things that are not nicotine can be healthy. It’s a jarring visual to see what looks like smoke coming out of someone’s mouth in a wellness ad, except brands like Breathe and its sister brands VitaminVape, VitaStik, BioVape, NutroVape, and Monq are doing just that.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p id="uHcoID">And like so many concepts that catch on in wellness circles, companies that sell these products take something with a veneer of scientific backing or credibility, couch it in language that sounds healthy, and then sell it to you via a marketplace with very little regulation or oversight. It’s not surprising that vape technology, which is so trendy right now, is the newest frontier for selling so-called wellness. But this technology is so new that it’s not clear if these vapes are helpful or harmful.</p>
<h3 id="GcEjTD">The genesis of a “healthy” vape</h3>
<p id="UtxAWA">The Breathe vape is a good case study in how the wellness industry uses an inkling of evidence to package a product as healthy. The company’s founder, George Michalopoulos, is not a physician, but during a phone call, he said he worked in social media. He developed a B12 vape in 2013 for his personal use, he says, because he was a vegan at the time. (Many vegans need to take vitamin B12 supplements so they don’t become deficient.)</p>
<p id="cGgJpa">He says he was interested in it because he “enjoys the process of vaping.” He points to a few studies done in the 1950s and ’60s that showed promise for the use of inhaled vitamin B12 for people with deficiencies, which are linked prominently on Breathe’s site.</p>
<p id="Wghf9V">Michalopoulos says people have told him anecdotally that their vitamin B12 levels increased after using it and have shared “copies of their blood test results” with him. He also said he is paying an outside lab to perform a clinical study, sometimes done by supplement and skin care companies, mainly for marketing purposes so that they can quote data and make more specific claims. “I’d rather people understand that this is still a young science,” he says.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/7014/4344/products/Smoking-Tuxedo_large.jpg?v=1538511810" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p id="rPWJpt">What he did not say in our phone call, but which I confirmed later, is that he also owns VitaminVape, which charges $39 for three pens. He founded it a few years before Breathe, which he launched at the end of 2017 to appeal to “vegans and B12 enthusiasts.” The website language, design, and testimonials are all the same as what’s on the Breathe website. The difference is that VitaminVape uses a synthetic form of vitamin B12 and Breathe uses a naturally-derived form. A representative said “serious vegans and wellness consumers” prefer the latter.</p>
<p id="gXxqH9">VitaminVape has been mentioned in<span> </span><a href="https://nowthisnews.com/videos/weed/nutriair-and-vitaminvape-selling-nicotine-free-vapes-with-supplements">several</a><span> </span><a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/2018/10/12/experts-warn-against-vape-vitamin-craze/">negative</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19546318/vitamin-vaping-is-it-good-for-you/">stories</a><span> </span>in the press exploring the legitimacy of these types of vapes, mainly pointing out that they are scientifically unproven and have potentially unknown risks.</p>
<p id="UKw0Dy">Michalopoulos is savvy about the claims that he makes for Breathe. The site states, “Each diffuser contains 100s of breaths of natural energy with no caffeine, no sugar crash, no calories and no nicotine.” It’s considered a supplement, and as such, the company cannot make any specific claims about what it supposedly can do. There is nothing about veganism on the site. The FDA can issue a warning to supplement companies that make claims that seem drug-like. Michalopoulos says he tells people to check with their doctors first, but that recommendation is buried in an FAQ section on the site.</p>
<h3 id="0T64xw">What is vitamin B12 and who needs it?</h3>
<p id="j3CAFX">Breathe sells only one type of vape, which it claims delivers vitamin B12. According to the company, five to 10 breaths equals “approximately 333 mcg of B12 (&gt;8,000% Daily Value).”<span> </span><a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/">Vitamin B12</a><span> </span>is a substance humans do not produce themselves yet need for a variety of important bodily functions like forming red blood cells, promoting neurological functioning, and synthesizing DNA. It’s present in foods like meat, milk, fish, and eggs, which is why vegans are often deficient.</p>
<p id="HasKun">There’s also a rare disease called pernicious anemia whereby people can’t absorb vitamin B12 via their gastrointestinal tracts because they lack an important protein called intrinsic factor. Older adults and people with other gastrointestinal problems can also be susceptible to vitamin B12 deficiencies. They can get it via injections or nasal sprays or gels, according to<span> </span><a href="https://weillcornell.org/ronaldcrystal">Dr. Ron Crystal</a>, the chair of the genetic medicine department and a practicing pulmonologist at Weill Cornell/New York Presbyterian. He’s also studied nicotine vapes and their propellants, which can include things like propylene glycol, flavorings of unknown origin, and glycerin.</p>
<p id="TCZpRs">What’s important to note, though, is that true deficiency is rare and you can’t self-diagnose it. Vitamin B12 deficiency can have vague side effects like fatigue, so doing proper lab testing through a doctor is crucial, according to Crystal. And taking too much vitamin B12 can have side effects such as rashes, acne, increasing blood pressure, facial flushing, and discolored urine. “It is a drug, essentially,” says Crystal.</p>
<p id="Snwnhu">“If you’re deficient, your doctor should prescribe what you should be doing. If you have normal levels, adding more doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t help,” he says. “The concept of just taking vitamin B12 to increase your energy and so on is a myth.”</p>
<h3 id="E5wGyT">Is inhaling vitamins a thing we should do in the first place?</h3>
<p id="N0itYe">But because some of the symptoms of deficiency are so vague, it’s a myth that has helped promote a long history of dubious vitamin B12 usage, popularized by celebrities. Who can forget the now-infamous<span> </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pzPNNQxWWM">episode</a><span> </span>of<em><span> </span>The Simple Life</em><span> </span>when Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie got vitamin B12 shots in their butts? (I, for one, cannot.) Madonna also gets them and supposedly once even<span> </span><a href="https://people.com/celebrity/madonna-will-sing-like-a-virgin-for-30-million/">administered</a><span> </span>one to Justin Timberlake. They’re commonly offered via injection or IV drip at wellness clinics; some<span> </span><a href="https://www.theivdoc.com/vitamin-b12/">services</a><span> </span>will even bring them to you.</p>
<p id="55pEmi">There’s not a lot of evidence that you can absorb vitamins by inhaling them, though. There have been no studies more recent than the old ones cited by Breathe and others, except for a few on<span> </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1873990/">nasal sprays</a>, which exist in prescription form. There certainly haven’t been any studies on B12 delivery via vape.</p>
<p id="rGDusF">Normally when you take a vitamin (or eat food, for that matter) enzymes in your stomach and all along your colon break it down until its smaller chemical components can be absorbed into your bloodstream. Nasally, vitamin B12 can be absorbed across epithelial cells, which line the nasal cavities and airways. Epithelial cells act as a gateway for things to be absorbed or blocked. This is how medicines like asthma inhalers are able to penetrate into the lungs.</p>
<p id="AVXQSz">Crystal says if a person is deficient, “the concept that vitamin B12 can be absorbed through the lung epithelial cells is a rational concept.” But he says this with caveats: For one, the effects of delivering that aerosol via vape are totally unstudied. “You’re putting something inside your body and it’s unknown.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/7014/4344/files/7vape_wholesale_product_dispaly_large.jpg?v=1540481346" alt=""></p>
<p>With vaping, there’s also the matter of the propellant, as well as the other chemicals that help give the formula its flavor and convert it into an aerosol when you puff. Heating up the liquid ingredients could potentially affect how they act in the body and produce new chemicals. They “may cause some damage to the cells,” according to Crystal, though he says we just don’t know for sure yet how that would look long-term.</p>
<p id="lqka1y">There haven’t been a ton of conclusive<span> </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882640">studies</a><span> </span>about vaping essential oils, flavorings, and propellants that can be in vaping fluids, but a preliminary<span> </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.01130/full">study</a><span> </span>on cells suggest that some flavorings might cause cell damage. Breathe uses<span> </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435699/">vegetable glycerin</a><span> </span>as its propellant, whose long-term effects when inhaled are not known. The bottom line is that no one really knows what kind of damage vapes, especially ones without nicotine, can do in either the short or long term.</p>
<p id="wFFK4P">The other potential problem is that because these products are considered<span> </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17199164/beauty-vitamin-collagen-turmeric-biotin">supplements</a>, they aren’t regulated by the FDA the same way drugs are. There’s not even a guarantee that the ingredients a company says are in a vape actually are there. Customers are expected to just trust that supplement companies are honest and that the ingredients are there in the amount they’re supposed to be. But studies, as in the one that was just released earlier this month that found 800 supplements were<span> </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/Those-dietary-supplements-you-re-taking-may-be-13303121.php">contaminated</a><span> </span>with prescription medications and other substances, prove that this is sometimes not the case.</p>
<p id="ZGJMft">Besides Breathe and VitaminVape, other brands on the market include VitaStik, which offers multiple combinations of essential oils and different vitamins, and Monq, which is just essential oils. Some brands call themselves a “mist” or “personal diffuser” or an “aromatherapy stick” and seem to want to avoid the word “vape.” Make no mistake, though: They are vapes.</p>
<p id="LzWoFI">The combination of an unproven mode of delivery plus a lack of regulation and transparency is something you’d be advised to stay away from. Even<span> </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/6/17435848/dr-oz-astrology-trump-adviser">Dr. Oz</a>, a person known to endorse all sorts of questionable practices, says to<span> </span><a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a47000/vitamin-b12-vaping/">skip it</a>. Need vitamin B12? Forget about<span> </span><em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em><span> </span>comparisons and … just eat breakfast.</p>
